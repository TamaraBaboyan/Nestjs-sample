About Elastic Beanstalk:
is service from AWS, that allows us to deploy applications. it has cool features.
we can define an application and then deploy multiple environments of that application.
Beanstalk will also configure logging for us, load balancing, networking, security groups... all this automatically!!
we can even use it to define a database for us.
In Beanstalk, everything is setup for us as part of the same deployment. This means, if we delete a depoloyment, we also delete everything.

Jest:
Jest automatically sets NODE_ENV to NODE_ENV=test, so we set it manually to development.
Jest automatically looks for files ending with ".spec.ts"
I don't want to run just run my test once, I want to watch my spec files. So anytime a spec file changes, I want to run my test again.
so I run it by watch flag:
$ yarn test --watch

mock functions can a lot for us. it can track how many times a function has called, it can track parameters with which a function has called.
it can simulate a certain behavior that we want for our specific testcase
